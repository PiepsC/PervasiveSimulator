# PervasiveSimulator
Masters project for the course Pervasive Systems

# Dependencies
I've intentionally kept the dependencies as small as possible as Electron on its own is already pretty bloated. No framework or CDN is being used. It only uses Electron-Forge for building purposes.

Download Nodejs and then run "npm install" in the repository to get the dependencies.
